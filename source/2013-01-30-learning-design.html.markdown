For the past two years, I have been dealing with implementing designs for iOS apps or web apps.
I sometimes wonder how designers or front end developers can create cool-looking buttons, or create
good-looking responsive websites.

I found these two small-but-concise books are really really great answers to my questions.
I don't usually finish books, but for me, it took half a week to finish these.

- [Designing Web Applications](http://nathanbarry.com/webapps/) by [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com)
- [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) by [Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com/)


There are other related books that I still plan to grasp, like [A Book Apart Full Bundle](http://www.abookapart.com/products/complete-library) and [PeepCode's Design Bundle](https://peepcode.com/products/design-bundle).
Also, I have been trying to understand [color theory](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/28/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/).

I don't think I have 'good eyes', but I'll keep trying to find how much understanding I'll be happy with.
