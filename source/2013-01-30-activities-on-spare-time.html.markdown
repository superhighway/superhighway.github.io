When the time comes, daily routines like working or going to school drain lots of energy.
It's important to spare some time to do things that will refresh your energy, so that you keep
your daily routine performance somewhat balanced.

I find at least there are 6 ways to replenish energy.


## Do New Things

Doing new things can be one of the easiest to do. It could be one-off activity that
does not require much commitment. Here are some examples.

- Travel to unknown place
- Learn new programming language
- Learn new language
- Learn new facts
- Talk to strangers
- Play around with public dataset
- Read new books
- Watch concert of a band that you've never heard of

One caveat is that you need to be slightly adventurous, or at least have some curiosity.

## Get in Touch with Familiar People or Things

- Meet your relatives
- Attend school reunions
- Watch concert of a band that you like

## Go for Work out

- Long walk
- Swim
- Take stairs
- Run
- Cycle
- Yoga

## Have a Regular Hobby

The following activities might not be straightforward because they need regular commitment.

- Play instruments
- Paint
- Do public speaking
- Cook

## Sleep

When you try all the above and none work, you can try to have a nap.
Sometimes just sleeping a bit will get you refreshed.

It's easy to say all the above, isn't it? Well, the actual execution requires lots of motivation.
For me, I am trying to have more of playing instruments
and reading books. I'd love to have working out as part of my spare time activity, and I'm still
looking for ways to make it work.
