# Transcribing Notes

- Copy beats as much as you can.
- Jpop emphasize rhythms after first beat (not the first beat).
- Study form through audacity. You can tag parts of sound.
- (So classical) pay attention to cadence.
- No need absolute pitch...
- Checkout Bach Chorus for quick key changes.
- Transcribing for digital piano, then playing it for piano can result in muddy noise...
