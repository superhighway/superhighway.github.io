    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How is design related to &lt;a href='https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/'&gt;PageSpeed score&lt;/a&gt;? After playing around with &lt;a href='/about.html'&gt;a bunch of side projects I built&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered these 4 things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More images can mean lower PageSpeed score, especially if the images are not optimized. So, if your site has images, be sure that they are optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How is design related to &lt;a href='https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/'&gt;PageSpeed score&lt;/a&gt;? After playing around with &lt;a href='/about.html'&gt;a bunch of side projects I built&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered these 4 things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More images can mean lower PageSpeed score, especially if the images are not optimized. So, if your site has images, be sure that they are optimized.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://fltdsgn.com/'&gt;Flat design&lt;/a&gt; uses color combination, but very few texture background, gradients, and other kinds of images. This can lead to high score. Of course, if images are used, number 1 above has to be fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Although you use CDN for your Javascript or CSS, the score will be a lot lower if they&amp;#8217;re not gzipped.&lt;br /&gt;I had 200kb scripts hosted on somebody else&amp;#8217;s CDN. Then, I gzipped it and hosted those on GitHub. The final size became 20-30kb, but I thought DNS lookup could be a lot slower. Anyway, just by gzipping those scripts, Google PageSpeed gave my site score higher by 30.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Look at &amp;#8220;Critical Path Explorer&amp;#8221; to check how and how long your site assets are downloaded. Though your score is so-so, maybe your site is actually quite decent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder Gmail page design looks so clean, and it is very performant as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Middleman or Jekyll?</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href='https://github.com/imathis/octopress'&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; before. When I saw &lt;a href='http://middlemanapp.com/'&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;, I immediately fell in love and left Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; has awesomely organized folder stucture and has lots of plugins. You can host Jekyll site as it is in GitHub, without any deploy script. It has a few themes you can pick, especially if you use Octopress. However, I like Jekyll better when the documentation has short getting started guide. It took me a while just to make things work initially. I have ever stuck just because I didn&amp;#8217;t install Python source code in my computer (I needed syntax highlighting). Also, when I first started using Jekyll, I had to read a lot of information from the documentation or Googling just because of a random problem (either related to syntax highlighting or Liquid).&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://middlemanapp.com/'&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; is amazingly lightweight and front-end friendly. The initially generated template is so simple that it works immediately, and anyone can customize it quickly. It comes with &lt;a href='http://middlemanapp.com/asset-pipeline/'&gt;asset pipeline&lt;/a&gt; by default, so it is just a few configs and a command line away to &lt;a href='http://middlemanapp.com/advanced/file-size-optimization/'&gt;minify assets, compress image&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href='http://middlemanapp.com/minify-html/'&gt;minify HTML&lt;/a&gt;. The documentation is pretty short as well. Unfortunately, Middleman doesn&amp;#8217;t have as many plugins as Jekyll. There is no deploy script available by default, and GitHub does not support hosting site organized with Middleman as it is. So, if you want to deploy Middleman-generated site, you need &lt;a href='https://github.com/tvaughan/middleman-deploy'&gt;middleman-deploy&lt;/a&gt;. Also, unfortunately, Middleman&amp;#8217;s folder structure can be more disorganized than Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://middlemanapp.com/'&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; are really really cool. You should try both and pick what you like.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I have been dealing with implementing designs for iOS apps or web apps. I sometimes wonder how designers or front end developers can create cool-looking buttons, or create good-looking responsive websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found these two small-but-concise books are really really great answers to my questions. I don&amp;#8217;t usually finish books, but for me, it took half a week to finish these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://nathanbarry.com/webapps/'&gt;Designing Web Applications&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href='http://nathanbarry.com'&gt;Nathan Barry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design'&gt;Responsive Web Design&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href='http://ethanmarcotte.com/'&gt;Ethan Marcotte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other related books that I still plan to grasp, like &lt;a href='http://www.abookapart.com/products/complete-library'&gt;A Book Apart Full Bundle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='https://peepcode.com/products/design-bundle'&gt;PeepCode&amp;#8217;s Design Bundle&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I have been trying to understand &lt;a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/28/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/'&gt;color theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I have &amp;#8216;good eyes&amp;#8217;, but I&amp;#8217;ll keep trying to find how much understanding I&amp;#8217;ll be happy with.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the time comes, daily routines like working or going to school drain lots of energy. It&amp;#8217;s important to spare some time to do things that will refresh your energy, so that you keep your daily routine performance somewhat balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find at least there are 6 ways to replenish energy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the time comes, daily routines like working or going to school drain lots of energy. It&amp;#8217;s important to spare some time to do things that will refresh your energy, so that you keep your daily routine performance somewhat balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find at least there are 6 ways to replenish energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='do_new_things'&gt;Do New Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing new things can be one of the easiest to do. It could be one-off activity that does not require much commitment. Here are some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel to unknown place&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Learn new programming language&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Learn new language&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Learn new facts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Talk to strangers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Play around with public dataset&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Read new books&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Watch concert of a band that you&amp;#8217;ve never heard of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that you need to be slightly adventurous, or at least have some curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='get_in_touch_with_familiar_people_or_things'&gt;Get in Touch with Familiar People or Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet your relatives&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Attend school reunions&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Watch concert of a band that you like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id='go_for_work_out'&gt;Go for Work out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long walk&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Swim&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Take stairs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Run&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cycle&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Yoga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id='have_a_regular_hobby'&gt;Have a Regular Hobby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following activities might not be straightforward because they need regular commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play instruments&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Paint&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Do public speaking&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id='sleep'&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you try all the above and none work, you can try to have a nap. Sometimes just sleeping a bit will get you refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to say all the above, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Well, the actual execution requires lots of motivation. For me, I am trying to have more of playing instruments and reading books. I&amp;#8217;d love to have working out as part of my spare time activity, and I&amp;#8217;m still looking for ways to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
