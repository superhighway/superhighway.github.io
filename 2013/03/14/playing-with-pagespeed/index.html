After playing around with <a href="/about.html">a bunch of side projects I built</a>, I discovered these 4 things.</p> <ol> <li>More images can mean lower PageSpeed score, especially if the images are not optimized. So, if your site has images, be sure that they are optimized.</li> <li><a href="//fltdsgn.com/">Flat design</a> uses color combination, but very few texture background, gradients, and other kinds of images. This can lead to high score. Of course, if images are used, number 1 above has to be fulfilled.</li> <li>Although you use CDN for your Javascript or CSS, the score will be a lot lower if they&#39;re not gzipped.<br/>I had 200kb scripts hosted on somebody else&#39;s CDN. Then, I gzipped it and hosted those on GitHub. The final size became 20-30kb, but I thought DNS lookup could be a lot slower. Anyway, just by gzipping those scripts, Google PageSpeed gave my site score higher by 30.</li> <li>Look at &quot;Critical Path Explorer&quot; to check how and how long your site assets are downloaded. Though your score is so-so, maybe your site is actually quite decent.</li> </ol> <p>No wonder Gmail page design looks so clean, and it is very performant as well.</p> <hr/> </div> <div id=footer> <p><a href="/">A Blog.
