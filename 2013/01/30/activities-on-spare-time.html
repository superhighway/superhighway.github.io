It&#8217;s important to spare some time to do things that will refresh your energy, so that you keep your daily routine performance somewhat balanced.</p> <p>I find at least there are 6 ways to replenish energy.</p> <h2 id=do_new_things>Do New Things</h2> <p>Doing new things can be one of the easiest to do. It could be one-off activity that does not require much commitment. Here are some examples.</p> <ul> <li>Travel to unknown place</li> <li>Learn new programming language</li> <li>Learn new language</li> <li>Learn new facts</li> <li>Talk to strangers</li> <li>Play around with public dataset</li> <li>Read new books</li> <li>Watch concert of a band that you&#8217;ve never heard of</li> </ul> <p>One caveat is that you need to be slightly adventurous, or at least have some curiosity.</p> <h2 id=get_in_touch_with_familiar_people_or_things>Get in Touch with Familiar People or Things</h2> <ul> <li>Meet your relatives</li> <li>Attend school reunions</li> <li>Watch concert of a band that you like</li> </ul> <h2 id=go_for_work_out>Go for Work out</h2> <ul> <li>Long walk</li> <li>Swim</li> <li>Take stairs</li> <li>Run</li> <li>Cycle</li> <li>Yoga</li> </ul> <h2 id=have_a_regular_hobby>Have a Regular Hobby</h2> <p>The following activities might not be straightforward because they need regular commitment.</p> <ul> <li>Play instruments</li> <li>Paint</li> <li>Do public speaking</li> <li>Cook</li> </ul> <h2 id=sleep>Sleep</h2> <p>When you try all the above and none work, you can try to have a nap. Sometimes just sleeping a bit will get you refreshed.</p> <hr/> <p>It&#8217;s easy to say all the above, isn&#8217;t it? Well, the actual execution requires lots of motivation. For me, I am trying to have more of playing instruments and reading books. I&#8217;d love to have working out as part of my spare time activity, and I&#8217;m still looking for ways to make it work.</p> </div> <div id=footer> <p>Theme by <a href="/">CatCyb.org</a>, powered by <a href="//middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a></p> </div> </body> </html>
