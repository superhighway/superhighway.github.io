This is my own opinion about myself. Feel free to leave this page now. Yes. Now.</p> <p>Right now.</p> <p>Bye. Good for you.</p> <p>I took personality tests and found out I mostly got different thing depending on what I am doing. Now I start to conclude that they&#39;re just tests to check which one I&#39;m actually comfortable with.</p> <p>Got INTP, ISFP, INFP... mostly maybe INFP? But being that is actually a little secluded, especially when working as programmer. According to some statistics, INFP is underrepresented in programer, making it really question my existence along the run.</p> <p>Took multiple intelligence tests, etc. Still getting different results.</p> <p>It seems like I can be anything. But then it&#39;s not right because I&#39;m merely a human.</p> <p>If I view programming as tool to finish tasks, definitely I&#39;d feel really sad and bored everyday. If I view programming as a medium, it&#39;s a little liberating. A medium to express emotions, questions or statements, for example. To express excitement, maybe more colors, exclamation mark, verbs, capitalization, bang sudden sounds, etc. Some programming languages are easy to express something than something else.</p> <p>It&#39;s really hard to judge. Once judged, it&#39;s probably wrong in certain contexts. If it&#39;s right, maybe because the wrong part isn&#39;t being highlighted.</p> <p>Definitely I&#39;m not the best programmer in the world, but statistically speaking, I&#39;m weird. Or rather I should be doing something else.</p> <p>Update: I went to consult somebody and he said I am being way too critical for too many cases, even for simple things. And yes I need to learn lots of things how to be a little bit more normal.</p> <hr/> </div> <div id=footer> <p><a href="/">A Blog</a></p> </div> <script>
