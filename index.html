However, I like Jekyll better when the documentation has short getting started guide. It took me a while just to make things work initially. I have ever stuck just because I didn&#39;t install Python source code in my computer (I needed syntax highlighting). Also, when I first started using Jekyll, I had to read a lot of information from the documentation or Googling just because of a random problem (either related to syntax highlighting or Liquid).</p> </p> <p class=read-more><a href="/2013/03/05/middleman-or-jekyll.html">Read more...</a></p> <h1><a href="/2013/01/30/learning-design.html">Learning Design</a></h1> <p class=article-meta> written on Jan 30, 2013 / <a href="/tags/design.html">design</a>, <a href="/tags/web.html">web</a> </p> <p><p>For the past two years, I have been dealing with implementing designs for iOS apps or web apps.
